# privacy-redicect Frontend App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the frontend for privacy-redirect you see in [privacydir.com/app](https://privacydir.com/app) address.

**Why do I need such a massive React framework for such a simple page?**

I'm glad you asked, I'd normally just go with a single html file with all css + vanilla JS embedded in it (or import `vue.js` in extreme cases). This is mainly due to my tendency of keeping things simple and being a believer of YAGNI principles.

However a few days before starting this project I got curious to find out the state of frontend development in 2022 (I'm a lifelong backend engineer). This led me to download the entire internet inside the `node_modules` folder and write my _very first_ React application.

## Technology

* React
* Webpack
* Scss
... sh*t tons of other packages needed to build frontend apps now a days.
